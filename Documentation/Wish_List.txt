Composite/Tritium Wish List
---------------------------

DRUM KITS: Conceptually, the Mixer volume of each instrument of a drum
kit /should/ be 0dB when you load the kit... and then you tweak it as
necc. for the song at hand.  However, since that fader is easy to get
at (whereas the instrument's gain setting is NOT)... it usually ends
up where the overall gain of the drum kit is being set on the mixer.
Would be nice if there was a button or feature that said something
like "Save mixer levels to drum kit."  This sets all the mixer levels
back to 0 dB, but sets the instrument gain so that there is no overall
difference. - Gabriel 2010-02-17
